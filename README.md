# Coloring Book
> A simple coloring book app without ads or other junk

This is a simple coloring book app I made for my kids. Most apps in App Store
contain ads, in-app purchases and other junk. This app is free from all that.

## Getting started

Make sure you have the [Flutter environment][flutter] installed.
[flutter]: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install

After you have set up the installer, you can run the app locally by

```shell
flutter run
```

This installs all necessary depenencies and runs the app on your local device.

### Building

You can build the project using:

```shell
flutter build
```

This creates a build of the app in the `build/` directory.

## Features

This coloring app has the following features:
* Multiple colors
* Many AI-generated coloring pages
* No ads, junk or in-app purchases
* Easy to use

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome.
